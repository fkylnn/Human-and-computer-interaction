ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project introduces Augmented Reality (AR) technology as an interactive way to learn about Indonesian traditional musical instruments. Indonesia has a rich cultural heritage with instruments such as angklung, tifa, sasando, bonang, kolintang, and gendang, each carrying unique historical and cultural value. Unfortunately, the younger generation is becoming less familiar with these instruments due to globalization and the rise of modern music.

By using AR, users can explore 3D models of traditional instruments, understand their origins, materials, and playing techniques, and even listen to their sounds. The application also includes quizzes and interactive features to make the learning process fun and engaging.

ðŸ›  Key Features

3D Visualization: Interactive models of traditional instruments.

Cultural Information: Origins, history, playing methods, and materials.

Audio Integration: Users can hear the authentic sound of each instrument.

Quiz Feature: Fun way to test knowledge about traditional instruments.

Support cultural preservation efforts through digital technology.

ðŸ“Š Methodology

Developed an AR prototype with six selected instruments.

Conducted surveys to evaluate usability and engagement.

Results: 90% of users found AR fun, simple, and easy to understand, but improvements are still needed in motivation and attractiveness.
